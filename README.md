# Night Writer (and reader)

## There is 2 runner files, *night_writer.rb* and *night_reader.rb*.

### *night_writer.rb* is ran with 2 arguments: first is the file to be translated, second is the file to store the translations.
1. Type any text you want (must be all lowercase) into message.txt
2. Run the file in your terminal like so: `ruby lib/night_writer.rb message.txt braille.txt`
3. Open up braille.txt and see your message newly translated into braille!
